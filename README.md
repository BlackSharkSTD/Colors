## Black Shark Color Palletes

Hi designer or programmer, we share some color palettes so that you can use them in your projects.

These palettes can be used by anyone, they are totally free.

### > Color Format
We made CSS files to save the colors you need, in this document it will be found in 3 different formats:
- HEX (#000000)
- RGB (0, 0, 0)
- HSL (0Â°, 0%, 0%)

These three formats work in most design programs and also work for web design.

### > Where can I open the CSS files?
You can open them wherever you want. You can open them in a notepad on your system or you can open it either in a code editor or you can open it from your browser.
